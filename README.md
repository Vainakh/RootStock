# RootStock

http://rootstock.herokuapp.com/

RootStock is a financial app aimed at providing certainty during uncertain times.

RootStock was built using the AngularJS frontend framework, along with Javascript, CSS and HTML.

User Stories:

A user can signup with Rootstock, fill out a short questionnaire, and be presented with three categories of portfolios based on the answers: Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive.

A user can pick 10 stocks based on each portfolio type and add them to their portfolio.

A user can update the 10 stocks at any time.

A user can then delete their individual Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive profiles, or delete the entire account.

Building the App:
Using partials and ng-Route, we were able to break down each piece of the site into its own partial - allowing for all of us to work on little pieces of the site at a time.
